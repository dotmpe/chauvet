Chauvet theme files
===================
:Created: 2022-03-30

A bright orange color theme.

These theme files use fonts patched for `Powerline extra symbols` (see `NERD fonts`_).

Status: vim and tmux config files should be usable.

- `Vim colorscheme <chauvet-vim>`_
- `Tmux statusbar <chauvet-tmux>`_

Focus is on 256 colorscheme, current palette is in rgb.txt.
Would like to define true 4-bit sRGB and work from LAB space definitions but need some tools.

Best format to write style rules is ofcourse CSS.
Using a SASS subset because that is easy to process
TODO: move rules to Chauvet.sass
