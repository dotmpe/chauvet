Chauvet theme files
===================
:Created: 2022-03-30

A bright orange color theme.

These theme files use fonts patched for `Powerline extra symbols` (see `NERD fonts`_).

Status: vim and tmux config files should be usable.

- `Vim colorscheme <chauvet-vim>`_
- `Tmux statusbar <chauvet-tmux>`_

Focus is on 256 colorscheme, current palette is in rgb.txt.
Would like to define 4-bit sRGB and work in LAB space but need some tools.
